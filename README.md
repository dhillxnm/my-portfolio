## Using Emojis

For adding emoji 😃 into the texts in Portfolio.js, use the emoji() function and pass the text you need as an argument. This would help in keeping emojis compatible across different browsers and platforms.

## Linking Portfolio to github

## On GitHub:

1. Create a new repository: Go to GitHub and sign in to your account. Click on the "New repository" button and give your project a name and description (optional). Choose whether you want the repository to be public or private.

## On your local computer:

2. Open your terminal: Launch your terminal application (e.g., Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).

3. Navigate to your project directory: Use the cd command to change the directory to the folder containing your project files.

4. Initialize a Git repository (if not already done): If you haven't already, initialize a Git repository in your project directory by running the command git init.

5. Add files to staging: Use the git add command to add the files you want to track in your Git repository. You can use git add . to add all files in the current directory.

6. Commit your changes: Run the command git commit -m "Initial commit" (replace "Initial commit" with a meaningful message describing your changes).

7. Copy the remote repository URL: Go back to your GitHub repository page and find the URL under the "clone" section. This URL points to the remote repository on GitHub that you'll be pushing your local commits to.

8. Add the remote repository: In your terminal, run the command git remote add origin <remote_repository_URL> (replace <remote_repository_URL> with the actual URL you copied from GitHub).

9. Push your local commits to GitHub: Finally, push your local commits to the remote repository on GitHub using the command git push -u origin main (replace "main" with the branch name if it's different).
